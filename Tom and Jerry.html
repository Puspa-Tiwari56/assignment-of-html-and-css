        <p>Tom and Jerry is an American slapstick comedy animated short series and media franchise.
            The original cartoons were created in 1940, written and directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera.
            It is named after its two main iconic characters: a blue-grey cat named Tom and a brown house mouse
            named Jerry. Each cartoon shows the two characters getting into comedic fights or chases, in which they
            often get hurt cartoon-style.</p>
